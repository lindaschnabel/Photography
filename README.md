# Photography

##Guide to the website
I decided I would pretend to be a professional wedding photographer. The website is meant to help clients get to know me and book sessions with me.
1.	Home: the home page gives you a glimpse into my branding
2.	Contact Us: This page has a form for clients to put their contact information in
3.	Gallery: Here you can find some samples of my “work” (these are actually stock images)
4.	Rates: A table detailing the different products I offer
5.	About me: A more personal section for clients to get to know me
